# UPaint!
UPaint! is a browser-based drawing and painting app created as a final project for Arts 1. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With UPaint, you can create digital art right in your web browser using various tools in a resizeable canvas.

UPaint! started off as a mini project to sharpen my skills in WebDev, but I never finished it. When the final project requirement for Arts 1 was announced, I decided that this project was the perfect output for me. Thanks to this requirement, I was able to utilize my skillset to create art that also allowed other people to create their own art. In other words, I was able to express my creativity in a way that also encouraged others to explore theirs.

## How To Use
UPaint! provides various tools and customizable canvas options to create any digital artwork.
- **Color Picker** allows you to choose any color to use in your artwork.
- **Pen** paints individual pixels with a solid color.
- **Texture Brush** applies a textured effect to the pixels by slightly varying the selected color.
- **Opacity Brush** allows you to paint with increasing transparency for making gradients.
- **Eraser** erases any area by resetting pixels to white.
